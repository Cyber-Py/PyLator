PyLator is a free translating service created by CyberPy, also known as LeShuriken1, using Python and HTML, hosted on Replit, and translated by the translate module which uses MyMemory API


First you need to input your text into the first box, then you can either press the `Submit` button, which will default the source language to `English`, and the destination language to `French`, or you could enter the 2-letter ISO language code, and then press the Submit button, then the input is sent to the program which translates it using the `translate` module, which uses `MyMemory API`, and will then output the translation.
