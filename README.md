Does anyone remember my [PyLator post](https://replit.com/talk/share/PyLator/146368) and how I created a program that can translate text from a language to another?
Well, [@VulcanWM](https://replit.com/@VulcanWM) and [@CodingElf16](https://replit.com/@CodingElf66) suggested that I create a website from it, and here I am, four months later, with a website. (It did not take four months to make, but one week)

So here's how to use the program works:

First you need to input your text into the first box, then you can either press the `Submit` button, which will default the source language to English, and the destination language to French, or you could enter the 2-letter ISO language code (there's a list at the bottom), and then press the `Submit` button, then the input is sent to the program which translates it using the [`translate`](https://pypi.org/project/translate/) module, then it will output.
